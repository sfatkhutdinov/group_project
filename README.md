## Milestone 1


It is very difficult today to comprehend the success of a politician in all levels of campaign and governance without looking at the social median. 
The social media is playing a very vibrant role today as far as communication is concern. 
This is gaining grounds as the root medium of getting to convince whatever audience a candidate of the political class wishes. 
Facebook, Tweeter and Instagram are on the forefront of leading social media platforms of communication for most politicians in the 21st century. 
Lots of valuable information is usually acquired via these mediums of communication especially tweeter. 
But one thing that stands out apparent is the fact that these data gotten from these media is just being structure of recent. 
Most of the data is very unstructured and needs lots of clean up to put context in to whatever file format we need for the data scientist to carry on analysis. 
The good news is that, the field of text mining is making a headway much faster as much of these data today can be processed via various 
hands-on software and applications for detailed analysis. The technique of finding words that frequently appear together and determining the relationship that exist between them is usually referred to as keyword-based association analysis. (Han, Kamber, & Pie, 2011). Association mining and word cloud are some of the text mining procedures that will be employed in the process.


          The focus of this report will be to use these keyword-based association analysis and some data visualization techniques to study how much a politician’s tweets could proof effective as far as the social media is concern.
The dataset chosen will be Donald Trump’s Tweets. This data has been provided in the UMGC repository for education and research purpose. The dataset contains Trumps tweets from 07/16/2015 to 11/11/2016. The dataset is composed of 7375 observations with 10 variables, which include the Date (date of the tweet), Time (Time of the tweet), Text, Type of Tweet, Media Type, Hashtag, Tweet ID, Tweet_url, Twt_favorite (number of likes) and retweets. Our main focus will be on the Text (that is the tweet text sent out by Trump). This variable contains the words we will extract that will be used for our text mining analysis. 


          This report will analyze the tweets that president Trump sent during his 2016 presidential campaigns in the USA. In this light, we will be looking at some charts to verify those words that appeared recurrently on his tweets. How much did these tweets affected his journey to the White House and what role did it play against his principal opponents like his principal contending candidate Hilary Clinton. The report analysis on text mining using R will also focus on his views on unemployment, climate change and other pressing issues that were on the table of debate during his campaign. As a data scientist we believe that there is a strong correlation between these tweets and some vital points that most voters deemed vital for their position of who to select as the next president. If we take an extensive look on the tweet’s messages, we will be able to get some understanding of Trump’s major points and what really was convincing enough to the voters.
